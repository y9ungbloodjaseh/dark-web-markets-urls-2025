## 1. We The North: Canada’s Homegrown Safe Haven

> *Review by “NorthernBuyer” (regular user)*
>
> “If you’re looking for a real market that doesn’t disappear after a few months, go with We The North. I’ve found the registration smooth, listings are well-organized, and the staff actually responds to questions. The escrow works great—my orders have always shipped, and vendor ratings match up with my experiences. Their restriction to Canadian buyers and sellers keeps things more trustworthy, in my opinion.”

### Features That Set It Apart:
- **Canada-Only Marketplace:** Serves only Canadian users—local focus means less noise, less risk, and higher reliability.
- **Strong Security:** PGP encryption required, 2FA for vendors, and a strict on-site communication policy (no Telegram or other contacts allowed).
- **Escrow & Reputation System:** Every transaction goes through escrow with transparent dispute handling, and vendors build reputation scores over time.
- **Prohibited Listings:** Weapons, explosives, and fentanyl are completely banned. No tolerance for “the worst of the worst”.
- **Variety:** Choose from fraud products, guides, software, cannabis, and much more.
